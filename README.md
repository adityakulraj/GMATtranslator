When you prepare for the GMAT the hardest for most of us is probably the quantitave part. However as the test is conducted in english there is a large amount of texts to read and fully understand with vocabulary rather uncommon in everyday speaking (or most of the articles you might read a day). Therefor learning new vocabulary is necessary for most non native speakers.

Vocab lists are easy to find, but most of them give an english explanation of what a word means, rather than the actual translation. Also you are bound to the flashcard or vocabulary trainer the person who prepared the list chose for you.

I wanted to use my own trainer and also I wanted to have the acutal translation into my language. Here's how:

I took one of the most comprehensive lists I've found (thanks to wordnet) and extracted just the english words (which are more than 4500). That way I could paste the list into google translator and got a german translation for the whole of the list to upload it into the vocab trainer I like.

The trainer of my choice is http://dict.cc . It uses the Leitner System which basically means the trainer will ask you less often for vocabulary you knew correctly and more often for the ones you didn't know. It allows to import the vocab list into the trainer and it is also available as an app (unfortunatly the trainer feature is only implemented in the iOS version).

Here's the link to both files, the tab seperated vocab list that includes the german translation and the one merely comprising the english words to paste into google translate: http://1drv.ms/1lW7j5U

If you know a good vocab trainer that has all the following features, please let me know. I can't find one. (currently I use PONS, but I don't really like the trainer).

1.It uses the Leitner system
2. allows to import own vocabulary
3. has a dictionary to find translations and immediatly add them to your vocab trainer
4. is available as an Android App (the dict.cc vocab trainer is currently only available for the iOS version)
5. Hope the lists helps you preparing for the GMAT. Please comment if you have something to add.
